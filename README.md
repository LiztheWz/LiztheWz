## Hi there! I'm Liz! 👋

I'm currently a senior at BYU studying Statistics and minoring in Business and Information Systems! My day mainly consists of going to classes, working as an Analytics Engineer, doing homework, and having fun with friends. I have experience with several data science tools such as R, Python, SQL, Excel VBA, and Tableau. As a first-gen, non-native English speaker, I tend to explain difficult data science concepts in a fun, interesting, and simple way.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on surviving college and finding an entry-level data analyst position.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with applying my skills to real-world problems.
- 💬 Ask me about my favorite dish to cook. Or data science questions.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy dancing. If money weren't an issue, I would be a performer.
